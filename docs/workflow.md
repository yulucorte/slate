# Day-to-day workflow

## Prerequisites

claude-harness uses a few standard CLI tools. Install whatever your environment lacks:

| Tool | Required for | macOS install | Linux install |
|---|---|---|---|
| `flock` | Concurrency protection in watcher hooks | `brew install flock` | Built-in on most distros (util-linux) |
| `gh` | PR automation (`HARNESS_AUTO_PR=true`) | `brew install gh` | `apt install gh` / `dnf install gh` |
| `python3` | PR comment capture in rollback-feature | Built-in | `apt install python3` |
| `shasum` or `sha1sum` | Project-scoped lockfile hashing | Built-in (`shasum`) | Built-in (`sha1sum`) |

After installation, run the `verify-harness-hooks` skill to check everything is wired correctly.

## Starting a new project

1. Install the plugin: `git clone ... ~/.claude/plugins/claude-harness`
2. In your new project: `bash ~/.claude/plugins/claude-harness/scripts/install-into-project.sh`
3. Run `bash init.sh` — verify it prints `[init.sh] OK`.
4. Commit: `git add progress/ features/ AGENTS.md init.sh && git commit -m "chore: add claude-harness scaffolding"`
5. Open Claude Code. The `using-claude-harness` protocol is now active.

## Starting a session

The SessionStart hook automatically:

- Runs `init.sh` and appends output to `progress/history.md`.
- Injects the last 30 lines of `history.md` under `## Recent history`.
- Injects all of `progress/current.md` under `## In flight`.
- Injects the first 10 active features under `## Active features`.

You don't need to manually read these files — they're already in context.

## Receiving a new requirement

1. Invoke `superpowers:brainstorming` → produces spec in `docs/superpowers/specs/`.
2. Invoke `superpowers:writing-plans` → produces plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/`.
3. Invoke `breaking-down-features` → creates FEAT-XXX entries in `features/backlog.md`.
4. Review the proposed features with the user before writing them if there are more than 3.

## Working on a feature

1. Invoke `managing-feature-list` to move the feature from `backlog.md` to `in-progress.md`.
2. Invoke `superpowers:subagent-driven-development` to dispatch subagents per task.
3. Before each subagent dispatch, invoke `tracking-progress` to log it in `progress/current.md`.
4. After each subagent returns, invoke `tracking-progress` to write the full report to `progress/subagents/<task>-STATUS.md`.
5. As subtasks complete, update `[x]` in the feature entry and update `Updated:`.
6. When ALL subtasks are `[x]`:
   - Run the declared verification method.
   - Paste the output into the feature's `### Notes` section.
   - Set `Verified: <today>`.
   - Invoke `managing-feature-list` to move to `done.md`.

## Ending a session

1. Invoke `handing-off-session` (or just close the session — the SessionEnd hook handles it automatically).
2. The hook drains `current.md` into `history.md` and commits everything.

## Recovering context in a new session

The SessionStart hook injects everything you need. But if you need more:

- `progress/history.md` — full changelog. Read the last N lines.
- `features/in-progress.md` — what's actively being worked on.
- `progress/subagents/` — full reports from previous subagents.

## Project hooks (v0.2.0+)

Beyond session-level hooks, claude-harness installs a layer of per-edit and per-tool hooks that run deterministically:

- `post-edit-format` — formats edited files (`HARNESS_FORMATTER=prettier|gofmt|ruff|none`)
- `pre-tool-safety` — blocks `rm -rf $HOME`, force-pushes to main, `git reset --hard`, config edits
- `stop-notify` — OS notification when Claude finishes (30s debounce)
- `post-edit-in-progress-watcher` — when `HARNESS_AUTO_BRANCH=true`, creates the git branch as a feature enters in-progress
- `post-edit-done-watcher` — when `HARNESS_AUTO_PR=true`, opens a PR as a feature lands in done; otherwise just notifies

All behavior controlled by `.claude-harness/config.sh`. Defaults preserve v0.1.0 behavior; opt in deliberately.

### Opting in to PR automation

1. Install `gh` CLI and run `gh auth login`.
2. Set `HARNESS_AUTO_PR=true` in `.claude-harness/config.sh`.
3. Optionally set `HARNESS_AUTO_BRANCH=true` to also auto-create branches at feature start.
4. Invoke the `verify-harness-hooks` skill to confirm everything is green.
5. From now on: moving a feature to `in-progress.md` may create its branch; moving to `done.md` may open its PR.

After PR approval, run `bash scripts/harness/pr-merge.sh FEAT-NNN` to merge + cleanup. If a PR is rejected, run `bash scripts/harness/rollback-feature.sh FEAT-NNN` to move it back to in-progress with the reviewer comments attached.

### Observability

Every hook invocation that proceeds past the file-skip check logs a line to `progress/hooks.log`. Format: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] hook-name EVENT_TYPE key=value...`. The file rotates at `HARNESS_LOG_MAX_BYTES` bytes; oldest rotation is gzipped.

## When something looks wrong

If a hook seems to misbehave, or you're not sure whether your install is healthy:

- Ask Claude to "diagnose harness" or "run harness doctor" — the `harness-doctor` skill runs `scripts/harness/doctor.sh` and walks you through each fix.
- Tail the log: `tail -f progress/hooks.log`
- Check the most recent hook events: `tail -30 progress/hooks.log`

If a watcher printed `→ harness: FEAT-X ready ...` but nothing happened, that's expected when `HARNESS_AUTO_BRANCH=false` or `HARNESS_AUTO_PR=false` (defaults). Ask Claude to run the suggested skill:

- `harness-create-branch` — creates the branch for a feature in `in-progress.md`
- `harness-open-pr` — opens the PR for a feature in `done.md`
